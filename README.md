## Description
The Airline Ticket Management System allows users to book, manage, and cancel flights through an intuitive interface, and also supports administrative functions.

## Project Requirements List
The following key functionalities are essential for the completion of the project:
1. **User Registration**: Allow users to register by providing essential information such as name, email, and password.
2. **Login**: Enable registered users to log in securely with email and password credentials.
3. **Adding Tickets**: Provide the ability to add new tickets, including details such as flight ID, seat number, and ticket price.
4. **Ticket Search**: Implement a search feature to quickly find tickets based on parameters like ticket ID or flight ID.
5. **Ticket Booking**: Facilitate ticket booking by assigning tickets to specific customers, confirming availability, and processing the booking.
6. **Booking Cancellation**:  Allow users or administrators to cancel a booking and update the ticket status accordingly.
7. **Administrative Functions**: Enable administrators to perform tasks such as managing flights, viewing user details, and generating reports.
8. **Database Connection Using DAO**: Ensure secure and efficient data operations by utilizing the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern for all database interactions.
9. **Implementation of MVC Architecture**: Follow the Model-View-Controller design pattern to separate data, user interface, and control logic for better maintainability.
10. **Exception Handling for Invalid Input**: Automatically clear the input fields after adding or editing employee records.
11. **UML Class Diagram**: Present a well-structured UML class diagram showcasing the relationships and attributes of the system's classes.
12. **Creating a JAR File**: Add project to the database and project information like title, description, dates. Package the application into a JAR file for easy distribution and execution.
